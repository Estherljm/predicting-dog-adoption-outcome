# Overview 
This project predicts the adoption outcome of dogs according to the dataset from **Austin Animal Shelter** from 2013 to 2018. 
Various feature extractions procedures will be performed to improve the ability to explain the model with better understanding. 

## Data pre-processing
Removing missing values and encoding will be done to prepare the dataset to better suit the machine learning models used.

## Modeling 
The 3 machine learning algorithms used are Random Forest, KNN and Logistic Regression. 

## Evaluation 
These models will be evaluated using accuracy and AUC. 

## Fine Tuning 
Grid and random search to improve the results of the model.
